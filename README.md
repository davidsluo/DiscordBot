# DiscordBot.java
This is a Discord bot I initially started writing in Java using the [Discord4J](https://github.com/nerd/Discord4J) library to interact with the Discord API and the [Discoordinator](https://github.com/alphahelix00/Discordinator) library for commands. This was largely a learning project, and I've since [rewritten the bot in Python](https://github.com/davidsluo/DiscordBot.py) for easier manipulation with arrays and maps (i.e. dictionaries).
